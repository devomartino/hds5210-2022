# Feedback on Final

Nice work on this final. There's a lot of flu and COVID data to work with.  So, I think this was a good choice.  You did a great job communicating your goals for the project and your approach to data analysis.
1. Be careful with your units. When you're interpreting the COVID and flu data, I think you're misreading the units.  COVID reached 120,000,000 active cases, whereas I think FLU capped out at 7,000,000 positive cases total for the year.  If I'm reading correctly.  It's tough to compare in this format: cummulative per year versus weekly active cases.  The data is a bit confusing. Did COVID really reach 1.2e8 as I'm reading on the chart?
2. One of the requirements was to use function to abstract or encapsulate logic. I didn't see that.

I think you did a great job of analysis overall. Nice job this semester.
